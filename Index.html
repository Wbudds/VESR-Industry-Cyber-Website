                <h3>Discipline</h3>
                <p>Discipline is good because it helps you stay focused and finish what you start. It also builds good habits that make reaching your goals easier.</p>
                <p>Discipline was ingrained in me through daily routines, clear rules, and support from people around me. I learned to stay focused, work hard, and keep going even when I didn’t feel like it. If you have a lack of discipline it's hard to get work done on time, you will miss good opportunities, and let bad habits take over. </p>

                <h3>Gratitude</h3>
                <p>Gratitude is valuable because it helps you notice the good things in your life. It makes you feel happier and more positive every day.</p>
                <p>Gratitude was taught to me by many things in the way I was raised and experiences. I was taught to say thank you, to appreciate what I have, and to notice the small good things in life even when times were hard. Having a lack of gratitiude will hurt relationships, and create a sense of entitlement which is awful.</p>

                <h3>Integrity</h3>
                <p>Integrity is important because it means being honest and doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. It helps people trust you and shows that you have strong values.</p>
                <p>Integrity was instilled in me by the values I learned from my family, and role models. My time in the Army reinforced this value as well. I was taught to be honest, keep my promises, and do what’s right, even when it’s hard. If you lack integrity people will not trust you and it will damage your relationships.</p>

                 <h3>Honesty</h3>
                <p>Honesty is important because it helps people trust you and feel safe around you. Being honest means telling the truth and not hiding things.</p>
                <p>Honesty was impressed into to me by the examples of my family and teachers who always told the truth. They showed me that being honest helps build trust and keeps friendships strong. Without honesty you can't trust anyone and others can't trust you. </p>
