                <h3>What is my business?</h3>
                <p>The business that my group chose was an accounting firm with a focus on forensic accounting.</p>

                <h3>What is my role?</h3>
                <p>As a forensic accountant my role is to investigate financial records to uncover fraud, theft, or other financial crimes. Forensic accountants analyze data and prepare reports that can be used in court or by businesses to resolve disputes.</p>

                <h3>What ethical issues could arise?</h3>
                <p>A forensic accountant could face pressure to alter or hide financial evidence to protect a client or employer. They might also struggle with staying impartial if they have personal or financial connections to the case. Upholding honesty and objectivity is essential, even when others try to influence their findings.</p>

                <h3>What cybersecurity issues could arise?</h3>
                <p>A forensic accountant could face the risk of hackers stealing sensitive financial data from their computers or company networks. They might also deal with phishing scams that try to trick them into revealing passwords or confidential information. Protecting data with strong security measures is crucial to prevent these threats.</p>

                <h3>What cybersecurity practices should be used?</h3>
                <p>A forensic accountant should use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication to protect accounts. They should keep software and antivirus programs up to date to defend against new threats. Avoiding suspicious emails and using secure networks when handling financial data also helps keep information safe.<p>
